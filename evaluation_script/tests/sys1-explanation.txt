The sentence segmentation of Sys1 is correct, so we can unambiguously refer to sent_id=1 and sent_id=2.

sent_id=1
       gold sys1 match note
tokens  11   10     9  Sys1 has one tokenization error: "Hey," as one token (and one word). So neither "Hey" nor the comma can be counted as matching.
words   11   10     9  There are no multiword tokens in the first sentence.
UPOS    11   10     9  All the matching words have correct UPOS. Note that "Hey,"/INTJ does not match "Hey"/INTJ.
other   11   10     9  Similarly for all other attributes (including HEAD, thus also UAS and LAS metrics have 9 matchings).

sent_id=2
       gold sys1 match note
tokens   4    3     2  Gold contains "I" + "'m" as two separate tokens, while Sys1 analyzes this as one multiword token.
words    4    4     4  However, both gold and sys1 have the same word forms "I" + "am", which are aligned by LCS.
UPOS     4    4     4  All the aligned words have correct UPOS.
other    4    4     4  Similarly for all other attributes (including HEAD, thus also UAS and LAS).
